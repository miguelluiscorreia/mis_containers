# Docker

There is a "Playground" with these examples running in a VM https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V2O84igzsGAFBz9lYV4dywtsMfFqnasB.

A good starting point is to scan the projects with KICS, https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics. KICS will help to identify the misconfigurations.

There are two flags inside the VM, and the service to exploit to get them with the intended path is the one exposed in port 80.
